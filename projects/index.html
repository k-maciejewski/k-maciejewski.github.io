<blockquote>
<p>The YCAS Young Scholars intensive summer program provides promising high school students entering 11th and 12th grade with the opportunity to learn about the work of biostatisticians in an academic environment. During this two week program, we introduce students to basic statistical methods and study designs used in medical research. We also provide instruction in “R,” a computer programming language for statistical analyses. Students work in teams and use real health science data to address study questions and develop a final presentation of their work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2020, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the <a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/ycas/training/young_scholars/">Yale Young Scholars Program</a> transitioned to an online format. I led the creation of online lecture and code materials, including recorded lectures, to allow for asynchronous viewing, for the R/Stats portion of the program. In 2020 and 2021, I co-taught the R/Stats portion to 12 gifted high schoolers, and supervised one of the two groups as they learned about the research process, analysed their datasets with R, and prepared their final presentations.</p>

<p>TidyTuesday is a weekly community activity by the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">R4DS Online Learning Community</a>. The goal is to help R learners learn in real-world contexts. My contributions and visualizations are also at <a href="https://github.com/k-maciejewski/TidyTuesdays/">my github</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Completed as a graduation requirement Columbia University in 2019, under the guidance of Lauren Martini at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysis of the NYC Community Health Survey (2016 - 2017), investigating depression, socioeconomic factors, and discrimination in NYC. Data management and analysis was in SAS and SAS-callable SUDAAN, and I produced a poster and manuscript report.</p>

<ul>
<li>Completed during my internship at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recreation of Tableau dashboard with fake data, aimed at beginner R-users and tutorial information of how to create a Shiny flexdashboard in R.</p>
<p>There was an existing Tableau dashboard about maternal prenatal and postpartum depression screening. Since sharing Tableau dashboards requires the user to download a reader, I was tasked with creating a dashboard that could be shared easily with Shiny, and so that the real data could easily be added. One of the main asks of this project was to incorporate a flexible and user friendly way to compare sites, which is why there are three options.</p>

<ul>
<li>Final project for Data Science 1 course at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, in collaboration with: Kathryn Addabbo, Peter Batten, Morgan de Ferrante, Nadiya Pavlishyn.</li>
</ul>
<p>I collaborated with peers to choose a data set appropriate for assignment, and discuss ideas for potential analyses. I mapped sentiments and attitude in the US tweets using ggplot in R, and converted this visualization into a shiny app. I assisted with some debugging for collaborators. I contributed to creation of project Rmarkdown report including discussion about US tweets, and over-all findings from all collaborators. I also assisted in the creation of a webpage in Rmarkdown and screencast describing the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Final project for Data Science 2 course at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, in collaboration with: Peter Batten, Morgan de Ferrante.</li>
</ul>
<p>I collaborated with peers to search for a data set appropriate for classification, and that was also publicly available for use. The BreastCancer data was used from the mlbench R package. I cleaned the data by removing NA&rsquo;s and converting factors to numeric values, performed some exploratory analysis, and performed logistic analyis in R.</p>

<ul>
<li>Final project for Biostatistics Methods 1 course at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, in collaboration with: Manqi Cai, Peng Lin-Lin, Yixi Xu.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset was given to us by the professor. Using R, I ran exploratory analysis of the cleaned data set, to see any possible correlations, outliers, or need to transform data. I recoded some variables for interpretability, tidied the data set and exported for use in SAS. I performed variable selection in SAS, which required me to independently learn how to use SAS Studio and the proper code. I then ran a linear model in R. I did some of the literature review necessary for this project, helped collaborators create summary tables, and proof-read majority of the report.</p>

<h4 id="overview-of-general-relativity">Overview of General Relativity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Completed at Fairfield University in 2015, under the guidance of Professor Shawn Rafalski.</li>
</ul>
<p>I solved the Schwarzschild Solution to Einstein&rsquo;s equations, with simplifying assumptions, such as a 2-D space. These solutions were applied in the MATLAB ODE solver, to visualize the effects of different initial conditions on the behavior of a test particle.</p>
