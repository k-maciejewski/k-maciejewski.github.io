R in SAS: Readying Your Machine to Call R In order to work with R inside SAS, we need to enable R language statements. To see whether RLANG is enabled on your machine, you can run:
 proc options option=rlang; run; One of two results will be printed to the log. You will either get a NORLANG, meaning you do not have permission to call R from SAS, or you will get RLANG, meaning you do have permission to call R from SAS.</description>

Most posts I found reference OS 11, but my computer was preloaded with OS 12. After many days, I finally found success.</description>
