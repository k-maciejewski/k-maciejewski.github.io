      <description>Note: this works on Windows machines; must have both software loaded on same computer
R in SAS: Readying Your Machine to Call R In order to work with R inside SAS, we need to enable R language statements. To see whether RLANG is enabled on your machine, you can run:
 proc options option=rlang; run; One of two results will be printed to the log. You will either get a NORLANG, meaning you do not have permission to call R from SAS, or you will get RLANG, meaning you do have permission to call R from SAS.</description>

      <description>I was so excited to update from my MacBook Air to the new Pro, especially since I added more memory and RAM.
However, I should have done more research as I didnâ€™t realize that not all software is running natively yet. I planned to use Rstudio, Tensorflow and Keras, for a new project so after I loaded the libraries as normal and ran the RStudio keras demo. And was met with a fatal error, then massive confusion and frustration.</description>
